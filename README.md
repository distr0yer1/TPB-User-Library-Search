# TPB-User-Library-Search

This is an application I crated one night after getting tired for searching through a user's Pirate Bay profile for particular torrents.
1. In the textbox next to "Username", put the profiles username.
2. Click the "Go" button
3. Wait for the "Apply Filter" button to become pressable or for the "Pages Loaded" counter to stop increasing
  -The more pages in a profile, the longer it takes.
  -I split the task of getting each page's information among 8 threads.
4. Use the "Apply Filter" function
  -The "Search" textbox filters based on exactly what is typed but is not case sensitive.
  -The radio buttons are for sorting by that category
  -Enabling the "High -> Low" checkbox sorts the items into order of high to low from top to bottom
5. Profit

WIP:
  -Category filter. Haven't needed it so I haven't coded it.
